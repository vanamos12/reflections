When will you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all you work local?
  When i want to share my work or when i don' want to loose my work (my harddrive can crash)
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
	When i am applying modifications to my work i don't want to always pull changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks creates a similar repository in my account in GIthub 
		i do it when i don't have the right to modify the initial repository 
	Clones create a similar repository in my computer.
	    I do it when i have the right to modify the repository or when i just want a copy 
		of the repository.
	breanches creates a new comit which has the parent of the past branching commit.
		i do it when i want to develop a new feature while conserving another feature.
		
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	I can use git diff to know the modifications introduced by the commit before doing a
	fast-forward merge.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Collaboration will be more efficient surely for automatic merge. 
	It will be difficult to collaborate with conflicting merges or manual merges.
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
    When creating a new branch other people can interact more easillly on the new feature you want to add.
	When working in master there is less more conflict in the developpement of the application.
