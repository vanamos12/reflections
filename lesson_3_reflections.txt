When will you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all you work local?
  When i want to share my work or when i don' want to loose my work (my harddrive can crash)
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
	When i am applying modifications to my work i don't want to always pull changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks creates a similar repository in my account in GIthub 
		i do it when i don't have the right to modify the initial repository 
	Clones create a similar repository in my computer.
	    I do it when i have the right to modify the repository or when i just want a copy 
		of the repository.
	breanches creates a new comit which has the parent of the past branching commit.
		i do it when i want to develop a new feature while conserving another feature.
